With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.</p></section><section class="main-section mt-4" id="exposure"><a class="anchor position-relative invisible" id="anchor-exposure"></a><header><h2>Exposure</h2></header><p>Exposure is the amount of light per unit area (the image plane illuminance times the exposure time) reaching a frame of photographic film or the surface of an electronic image sensor, as determined by shutter speed, lens aperture, and scene luminance. Exposure is measured in lux seconds, and can be computed from exposure value (EV) and scene luminance in a specified region.</p><p>A photographic film (or sensor) has a physically limited useful exposure range, usually called its dynamic range. If, for any part of the photograph, the actual exposure is outside this range, the film cannot record it accurately. In a very simple model, for example, out-of-range values would be recorded as "black" (underexposed) or "white" (overexposed) rather than the precisely graduated shades of colour and tone required to describe "detail". Therefore, the purpose of exposure adjustment (and/or lighting adjustment) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film, so that 'significant' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film's useful exposure range. This ensures that no 'significant' information is lost during capture.</p><p>To control exposure, there are 3 parameters photograhers need to consider:</p><ul class="list-unstyled ml-4"><li>Shutter speed</li><li>Aperture</li><li>ISO</li></ul><p>This parameters can be calculated manually by the photographer to achieve the desire exposure based on light conditions. In modern cameras, there are different options to calculate exposure:</p><ul class="list-unstyled ml-4"><li>Manual exposure: The photographer decide each parameter.</li><li>Shutter priority: The photographer decide the shutter speed and the camera choose an appropriate aperture value.</li><li>Aperture priority: The photographer decide an aperture value and the camera choose an appropriate shutter speed.</li><li>Automatic exposure: The camera decide all parameters.</li></ul></section><section class="main-section mt-4" id="shutter_speed"><a class="anchor position-relative invisible" id="anchor-shutter"></a><header><h2>Shutter Speed</h2></header><p>Shutter speed or exposure time is the length of time when the film or digital sensor inside the camera is exposed to light, also when a camera's shutter is open when taking a photograph. The amount of light that reaches the film or image sensor is proportional to the exposure time.</p><p>Shutter speed is one of several methods used to control the amount of light recorded by the camera's digital sensor or film. It is also used to manipulate the visual effects of the final image.</p><p>Slower shutter speeds are often selected to suggest the movement of an object in a still photograph.</p><p>Excessively fast shutter speeds can cause a moving subject to appear unnaturally frozen. For instance, a running person may be caught with both feet in the air with all indication of movement lost in the frozen moment.</p></section><section class="main-section mt-4" id="aperture"><a class="anchor position-relative invisible" id="anchor-aperture"></a><header><h2>Aperture</h2></header><p>Aperture is a hole or an opening through which light travels. In photography, aperture refers to the diameter of the aperture stop rather than the physical stop or the opening itself.</p><p>The lens aperture is usually specified as an f-number, the ratio of focal length to effective aperture diameter. A lens typically has a set of marked "f-stops" that the f-number can be set to. A lower f-number denotes a greater aperture opening which allows more light to reach the film or image sensor.</p><p>The aperture stop of a photographic lens can be adjusted to control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor. In combination with variation of shutter speed, the aperture size will regulate the film's or image sensor's degree of exposure to light. Typically, a fast shutter will require a larger aperture to ensure sufficient light exposure, and a slow shutter will require a smaller aperture to avoid excessive exposure. The following combination of aperture and shutter speed will produce the same exposure:</p><code class="ml-3 text-primary d-block">f/5.6 1/200s</code><code class="ml-3 text-primary d-block">f/8 1/100s</code><code class="ml-3 text-primary d-block">f/4 1/400s</code></section><section class="main-section mt-4" id="iso"><a class="anchor position-relative invisible" id="anchor-iso"></a><header><h2>ISO</h2></header><p>Film speed is the measure of a photographic film's sensitivity to light, determined by sensitometry and measured on various numerical scales, the most recent being the ISO system. A closely related ISO system is used to describe the relationship between exposure and output image lightness in digital cameras.</p><p>Relatively insensitive film, with a correspondingly lower speed index, requires more exposure to light to produce the same image density as a more sensitive film, and is thus commonly termed a slow film. Highly sensitive films are correspondingly termed fast films. In both digital and film photography, the reduction of exposure corresponding to use of higher sensitivities generally leads to reduced image quality (via coarser film grain or higher image noise of other types). In short, the higher the sensitivity, the grainier the image will be. Ultimately sensitivity is limited by the quantum efficiency of the film or sensor.</p><p>If we take the example above and include ISO into account now, the following values produce the same exposure:</p><code class="ml-3 text-primary d-block">f/5.6 1/200s ISO 200</code><code class="ml-3 text-primary d-block">f/4 1/200s ISO 100</code><code class="ml-3 text-primary d-block">f/8 1/400s ISO 800</code></section><footer class="text-center mt-5"><p>Created by Alejandro Aburto for a freeCodeCamp challange.</p></footer></main><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-Piv4xVNRyMGpqkS2by6br4gNJ7DXjqk09RmUpJ8jgGtD7zP9yug3goQfGII0yAns" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="./script.js"></script></body></html>
